blogapi is a simple node.js module.  You will find it in the modules
directory of this repo called, logically enough, blogapi.js.

The API exposes two methods, fetchEntries and postEntry:  

  fetchEntries( request, response, dbHandle )
     postEntry( request, response, dbhandle )

Both methods have the same signature modelled after the typical
request listener formula used by a generic HTTP Server's 
handle_request function and with an additional parameter
to use the required backend store, a sqlite3 database.

The blogapi module uses a sqlite3 database backend for persistance storage.
An example database is provided in the ./tests directory, along with 
several JSON files for testing the API.  See the README.txt file in
the ./tests directory for more details.

TO USE

Simply require the blogapi module and then pass a request, response, and
database reference the methods described above.  

To support implementation a reference HTTP Server that implements the 
blogapi has been provided in the ./test directory.  To use copy it 
to the parent directory and then run:

node server.js

You then can follow the instructions in the ./test/README.txt file
to use cURL to add blog entries (method postEntry() ) or list
all blog entires (method fetchEntries() ).
