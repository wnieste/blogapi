cURL strings for testing.


Assuming the server hosting this API is running on localhost and listening on port 8088.
Furthermore we have a datafile with a single blog post in JSON format as post.json.

for the /posts endpoint (assume running on localhost and listening to port 8088) -
   curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8088/posts

for the /post endpoint -
   curl -d @post.json --header "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8088/posts
